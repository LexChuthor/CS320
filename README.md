# CS320 - Testing
## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best way to ensure that the program is functional and secure is to utilize a multitude of tests that check if the functional and non-functional requirements have been met. These include things such as ensuring that the program functions as intended, as well as testing various facets of the architecture, security, etc.
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I typically intepret user needs by gathering requirements as specifically and granularly as possible.  By establishing requirements as specifically as possible, it then becomes a matter of researching incorporating the various code, architecture, and other resources necessary to meet those requirements as closely as possible.
## How do I approach designing software?
Like intepreting user needs, I establish the requirments of the software as specifically as possible, and then design the software around meeting those requirements.
